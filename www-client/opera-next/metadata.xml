Opera is a graphical Web browser available on several platforms. The desktop
version runs on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD. Versions for Macintosh and
Windows are also available.

Opera Next is a stand-alone installation of the Opera desktop browser intended
for testing the development of new features, technologies, and improvements. It
is automatically updated to include the latest changes as they become available.
As such, it may be unstable and include known issues, such as crashes or data
loss situations.

Opera Next is an entirely separate product to the official
<pkg>www-client/opera</pkg> browser product, which is the stable product
intended for day-to-day use. There is no connection or interaction between them
unless you manually configure this; all preferences and settings are saved for
each product individually. For example, a bookmark saved in Opera Next will not
display in your primary Opera browser. This ensures that your valuable data and
settings remain untouched when you try out our latest changes.
