  21 Feb 2007; Markus Ullmann <jokey@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  Redigest for Manifest2

  20 Aug 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; metadata.xml:
  Change herd to cjk, since the only package still in the tree depending on
  this is fbiterm, which is cjk herd.

  29 Feb 2004; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> libiterm-mbt-0.5.ebuild:
  Added to ~amd64 since y-windows depends on it (I assume it's been tested since
  y-windows is in ~amd64).
